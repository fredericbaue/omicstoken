I'm facing a recurring issue that's preventing me from installing the required dependencies for your project. I've already updated the `requirements.txt` file, but I'm unable to execute the `pip install` command. Please run the following command in your terminal to install the updated dependencies:

`.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt`

After the installation is complete, please try running the application again.
